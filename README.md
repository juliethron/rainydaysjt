This is my attempt at doing an HTML and CSS version of a site I designed in Figma. The site is for a new set of versatile outdoor jackets. There are a few small things here and there I would wanna fix, but I did not end up having time to fix them. But for my first attempt at coding a website I do not think it is that bad.
